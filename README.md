> Insist on simplicity. Resist special cases. Listen to conditionals. Identify underlying concepts. And search for the abstractions that let you treat everything the same.

## Overview

There is a school of thought that conditionals in your code, especially excessive conditionals, indicate a deeper issue. In object oriented programming, we should strive to keep our classes as simple as possible. When we add conditionals, we split the path through our code. This adds complexity! Adding conditionals also often forces us to add _more_ conditionals to account for this complexity. This is another underlying problem with conditionals; they _breed_.

In large code bases, we can easily lose track of the paths that we're creating, meaning code gets harder and harder to test. To combat this, we should strive to reduce conditionals wherever possible. We should think about _why_ we need to split our logic into paths, and see if there is a tool in the OO toolbox to alleviate this problem.

This GitHub Action is designed to help developers and teams keep track of their conditionals as they are added. The relevant files in the codebase are parsed to determine where there are `if` statements.

One problem people often mention about efforts to reduce conditional logic is that sometimes we _need_ conditionals to handle unknowns. A good example is handling user input. The answer to this is thought to be _pushing_ all of our conditional logic into a specific layer of the code. That way, we can internalise the unknowns, set up our object models to be maximally polymorphic, and proceed with as few paths through the program as possible.

Unconditional allows for this fact by letting users specify these files that will be conditional-dense.
